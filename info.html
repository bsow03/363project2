                <dl>
                    <dt class="has-text-weight-bold">What APIs did you use, and what data did they provide?</dt>
                        <dd>In this project, I used several APIs for several different reasons. The API that I used was the API-NBA from RapidAPI to display information about NBA teams. The first div displayed a random NBA team along with their record, standing in their conference, and win percentage. The next div displayed the conference standings, so users can see where in the conference they were and what teams were in their conference.</dd>
                        <dd>ii.	The next API that I used was the YouTube API Data v3 from YouTube. This API, allowed me to display three different highlight videos of the team in past games in the season.</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt class="has-text-weight-bold">Describe how you handled promises and async operations.</dt>
                        <dd>Async operations reminded me of coding in other languages that I have used in the past. What I mean by this is that in order to use async operations, you have to define the functions with their parameters and say what they will do. After defining the function, you have to call the function again in order to use it in your code.</dd>
                        <dd>Additionally in each of my functions, I used try, catch, and a couple of console.log statements to ensure that the async operations worked as they were supposed to. </dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt class="has-text-weight-bold">How did you structure the data on your page?</dt>
                        <dd>I used the Bulma framework along with css to make styling and structuring the data easier. I used flexbox to ensure that the data I was pulling from the APIs were structured nicely and created a better user experience for the user.</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt class="has-text-weight-bold">What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?</dt>
                        <dd>Doing this project, I encountered a plethora of issues. This project alone was a lot of code, the methods that helped me the most through these issues were using the console.log property, W3schools documentation, and the API documentation from each API.</dd>
                        <dd>The main issues that I encountered were trying to access the data in the APIs, these APIs (especially the NBA one) contained large amounts of data and accessing the data to display what I want was difficult at times. It was even harder trying to do this while creating my async functions at times, because some names that I used for parameters were similar to other names in the documentation leading me to confusion a lot of the times while coding.</dd>
